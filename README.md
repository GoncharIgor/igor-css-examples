## What is it

I like play with css for fun. In this repo I aggregate all the interesting css solutions for different:
- styling challenges
- new libs usage in vanilla js environment
- new css features

## Demo

Here is the running [demo](https://igor-css-playground.netlify.app/) of deployed static files

## Usage

Everything is straight forward as the whole project - is a set of static html files

If you want to play with it, you can `git clone` the repo
